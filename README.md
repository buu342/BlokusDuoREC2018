# Arduino Blokus

A game of Blokus Duo, meant to run on an Arduino for the competition:

[XIV Jornadas Sobre Sistemas Reconfigur√°veis, FCT/Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Fevereiro 2018](https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~ist14551/BlokusDuo2018/rules.html)

If you're not sure what these files are for exactly, then a lot of what's happening might not make sense. If that's the case, go read up on the competition (Be wary that the source is in Portuguese)

Compile make and press enter for stuff to happen.

Or use the arduino file along with the Terminal.exe
